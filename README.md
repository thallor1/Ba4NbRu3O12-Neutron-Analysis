# Ba4NbRu3O12-Neutron-Analysis
 Repository to document the analysis of SEQUOIA and MACS Ba4NbRu3O12 data. Direct NXSPE files available upon request. 

There are a number of jupyter notebooks showing each step of the work, as described throughout the SI of the eventual publication. They are summarized by the following:

1) Mathematica notebook for calculation the analytical form factor anisotropy for the magnetic trimer.

2) MACS measurement, including normalization, absorption, and isolation of magnetic scattering. 

3) SEQUOIA measurement, including normalization, absorption, and isolation of magnetic scattering.  

4) The plotting and modelling of these data are then done in a fourth notebook, which is also where the paper figures are generated. 

The analysis requires a few python modules, some of which are my own code. All should be available on github, and the pulls are automatically performed in the jupyter notebooks. Of course, you will either need to have a working git installation or manually add the modules to your path. If you are having trouble doing so please contact me at thomas.halloran@nist.gov.
